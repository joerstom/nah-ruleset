  * §7.3.2.1 – This movement is referred to as ‘screening’ or ‘picking’ and is defined as using bike movement and position to abruptly and/or continuously block an opponent from taking a direct line to a loose ball, challenge the player in possession of the ball, or gain a defensive or offensive position on the court.

  * §7.4.3 – If both players are within the transition area around their team's door and either player actively interferes with the ball or ball carrier, an Illegal Substitution penalty is assessed as a Minor penalty and must be served by the player who perpetrated the action.

**§7.5 – Crease Violation**

* §7.5.1 – Only one defensive player \(the “Goalie”\) is allowed to be within the crease prior to the ball/ball carrier for more than 3 seconds.

  * §7.5.1.1 – At the point the ball enters the crease, players can also enter the crease to make a fair play on the ball.

    * §7.5.1.4.1 – If the penalty is committed while their opponent has no scoring opportunity, a ball turnover is assessed. Subsequent penalties elevate by one degree to a Minor and then Major penalty regardless of which player on the offending team commits the infraction.
    * §7.5.1.4.2 – If the penalty is committed while their opponent has a clear scoring opportunity because of a shot, pass or loose ball in or near the crease, a Minor penalty is assessed immediately on the first occurrence of the infraction.
