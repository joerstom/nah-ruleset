# Section 5: Ball Handling

**§5.1 – Possession**

* §5.1.1 – The player who made the last deliberate controlled touch on the ball is considered to have possession. No player is considered to have possession, or possession is forfeited, if:
  * §5.1.1.1 – The ball moves approximately 12 to 15 feet \(12-15' or 3.6 - 4.5m\) out of the immediate proximity of the player in possession.
  * §5.1.1.2 – The ball moves so quickly through a player's immediate proximity they cannot make more than 1 controlled touch on the loose ball.

**§5.2 – Shooting**

* §5.2.1 – If the final contact on the ball is made with either round end of a player's mallet head, it is considered a shot.
* §5.2.2 – A 'shuffle', 'ball-joint', 'scoop' or 'carry' is not a shot.
* §5.2.3 – Actively directing the ball into the net by making contact with any part of the body or bike is not a shot.
* §5.2.4 – Any contact made with the shaft of the mallet is not a shot.

**§5.3 – Shuffling**

* §5.3.1 – A shuffle is defined as any contact between a broad side of the mallet head and the ball.
* §5.3.2 – A shuffle by the offensive team which enters the opposing team’s goal is not awarded a point. In this case a restart occurs per §4.2.3. The team that shuffled the ball into the net forfeits possession.

**§5.4 – Ball–Jointing**

* §5.4.1 – Ball–jointing is defined as applying pressure on the ball using any hole or concave surface in the mallet head in order to trap it against any playing surface on the court.
* §5.4.2 – Ball–jointing is permitted for a time period of 2 seconds anywhere on the court. 
* §5.4.3 – The Referee counts out-loud for 2 seconds and signal a Ball-Jointing penalty, which results in a ball turnover and can be escalated to a Minor or Major at the Referees discretion.

**§5.5 – Scooping**

* §5.5.1 – A scoop is when the ball is cupped in any hole in the mallet head using centripetal force and is maneuvered, whether it be on the ground or in the air.
* §5.5.2 – Scooping is permitted for a time period of 2 seconds anywhere on the court.
* §5.5.3 – The Referee counts out-loud for 2 seconds and signals a Scooping penalty, which results in a ball turnover and can be escalated to a Minor or Major at the Referees discretion.

**§5.6 – Carrying**

* §5.6.1 – Carrying with a mallet is defined as picking up the ball, beginning as a “scoop”, and carrying it in the air, in any hole in the mallet head, with gravity providing the force which holds the ball in the mallet head.
* §5.6.2 – Carrying with the body is defined as using a hand, or other part of the body, to shoot, pass, or otherwise deliberately redirect or add momentum to the ball. If a player uses their hand to “catch” the ball out of the air they must immediately drop the ball on the ground below the point at which the ball was caught.
  * §5.6.2.1 – A defensive player within their own crease may deliberately redirect, but may not "catch", an airborne ball that is below shoulder height to prevent it from entering the net. 
* §5.6.3 – Carrying is not permitted and results in a ball turnover, subsequent carrying penalties can escalate if the Referee deems them to be excessive.
